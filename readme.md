While working on this project, I have learned a lot about how to make dynamic changes to the DOM elements. The factory pattern is really useful for this purpose because it encapsulates element creation by providing all the necessary data to edit the element without making any changes to the other elements. It's pretty cool!

To create the activity and register elements, I have implemented separate functions. Inside these functions, I have divided the code into two parts. The first part creates the elements, and the second part contains the logic for all user interactions.
